== Introduction

== Stuff

=== Food
One unit of FOOD is enough to feed a single member of the POPULATION for one TURN (one calendar quarter).

Persons that are forced to consume less are at risk of STARVATION. They also have an increased risk of becoming MALCONTENTS.

Persons on a COLONY will try to stockpile food if at all possible.
